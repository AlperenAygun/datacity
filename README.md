# Datacity

Datacity app is developed in Flutter for project with using Elastic Search. App gets data from my localhost for now so if you want to try you cannot see anything when you are searching.

I did not use elastic_search package for flutter for now. I just send GET request to the API.

P.S : I downloaded city dataset from Dtat World website

You can search country 

- by name.

- by country.

- by latitude/longtitude.
